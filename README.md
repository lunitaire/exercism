# exercism.io
Exercism.io is a free, Open Source coding exercise site for leveling up programming skills. They are currently in beta and have over 30 different languages as part of their repertoire.

I am currently using exercism.io for two reasons
* To mentally cement the syntax differences between different languages that I have studied
* To participate in a WeAllJS's \#learning slack community
